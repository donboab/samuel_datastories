									<h1>Food Supplement Sales</h1>
									<p>Dashboard For Food Supplement Sales in USA, UK And Canada (2020-2025).</p>
								</header>
								<h3>Dashboard Overview</h3>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/featureImg_Food_supplement.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h3>Goal</h3>
								<p>
									The primary objective of this project was to design an intuitive, insight-driven dashboard that empowers stakeholders in the health and wellness e-commerce space to monitor, compare, and analyze supplement sales trends across the USA, UK, and Canada. By leveraging weekly sales data from multiple platforms (Amazon, Walmart, and iHerb), this dashboard provides a centralized view of revenue performance, product returns, discount effectiveness, and category-level dynamics from 2020 to early 2025.</p>
									<p>The goal was to create a simple yet powerful Excel dashboard to support strategic decision-making by answering key business questions such as:
										<ul>
											<li>Which countries and product categories are driving the highest revenue?</li>
											<li>How do discount strategies influence revenue generation across different supplement types?</li>
											<li>Which platforms are consistently leading in sales for top-performing products?</li>
											<li>What return trends should we be aware of across product categories?</li>
											<li>How has revenue evolved year-over-year, and which categories contribute most to business growth?</li>
										</ul>
										The dashboard is tailored for use by marketing leads, category managers, and e-commerce strategists who need quick, actionable insights to optimize product offerings, pricing, and promotional strategies in a highly competitive market.</p>

								<h3>Tools & Skills Used:</h3>
								 <p><ul>
									<li>Microsoft Excel:<span> PivotChart, PivotTable, Excel Formulas, Conditional Formatting, Slicers, Timeline </span>
									</li>
									<li>Data cleaning and transformation</li>
									<li>Data visualization and dashboard design</li>
									<li>Analytical thinking for business-focused insights</li>
								</ul></p>
								<h3> Project Description</h3>
								<p>This project focused on exploring sales data for health and wellness supplements sold online across the USA, UK, and Canada between 2020 and 2025. I built a dynamic Excel dashboard to help stakeholders quickly understand how different products, platforms, and markets performed over time.The idea was to turn raw data into something that could actually support business decisions—whether that’s identifying which products are selling best, seeing how discounts are impacting revenue, or spotting trends in product returns.Here’s a breakdown of what the dashboard includes:
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Total Revenue by Country:</strong>
											<span>A clear snapshot of how much each country contributed to overall sales, helping compare market performance at a glance. </span>
										</li>
										<li><strong>Revenue from Discounted Sales by Category:</strong>
											<span>This chart shows how discounts influenced revenue across supplement categories like Protein, Vitamins, and Omega. It’s great for seeing where markdowns are actually working.</span>
										</li>
										<li><strong>Top 5 Products Sold by Platform:</strong>
											<span>Highlights the best-performing products on Amazon, Walmart, and iHerb—helping pinpoint which platforms are best for certain products.</span>
										</li>
										<li><strong>Return Rate by Category:</strong>
											<span>Gives visibility into which product categories had higher return rates, which can flag quality issues or customer dissatisfaction.</span>
										</li>
										<li><strong>Revenue Trends by Year:</strong>
											<span>A year-over-year view of how total revenue changed from 2020 to 2025, revealing broader business growth or slowdowns.</span>
										</li>
										<li><strong>Total Revenue by Category:</strong>
											<span>This gives a sense of which categories are driving the most sales, which is useful for product strategy and inventory planning.</span>
										</li>
								</ul>
									To make exploration easier, I added interactive filters so users can drill down by time period, country, product category, and discount range.
								</p>
								<h3> Key findings</h3>
								<p><ul>
									<li><strong>Regional Revenue Performance:</strong>
										<span>The dashboard clearly shows which countries generated the highest revenue from supplement sales. Canada emerged as the top-performing market, while the United Kingdom showed potential for growth with lower yet steadily increasing revenue figures.</span>
									</li>
									<li><strong>Impact of Discounts on Sales:</strong>
										<span>Analysis revealed that discounting strategies significantly influenced revenue in certain categories. For instance, Mineral products in each of the three countries saw a noticeable lift in sales during discounted periods, suggesting that price sensitivity plays a role in customer behavior for these products.</span>
									</li>
									<li><strong>Platform-Specific Product Success:</strong>
										<span>The top five products sold on Amazon,iHerb, and Walmart varied by platform, showing that customer preferences differ across e-commerce channels. This insight can help businesses tailor their product placement strategies for each platform.</span>
									</li>
									<li><strong>Return Patterns by Category:</strong>
										<span>Some categories had consistently higher return rates than others. For example, Vitamin in the United Kingdom had a return rate of 33%, signaling a possible issue with customer satisfaction, packaging, or product expectations</li></span>
									</li>
									<li><strong>Revenue Distribution by Year:</strong>
										<span>Using a pie chart, I visualized how total revenue was distributed across each year from 2020 to 2025. This made it easy to spot which years contributed the most to overall sales. Year 2023 has the highest share of revenue, highlighting a peak period in the business. This breakdown also gives a clear view of how the business has grown continuously over time and can help explain the impact of external factors like market trends, seasonal demand, or promotional efforts.</span>
									</li>
									<li><strong>Category Contribution to Revenue:</strong>
										<span>Vitamins and Mineral were among the top contributors to overall revenue. This insight supports better inventory planning and marketing focus on high-impact product lines.</span>
									</li>
									</ul>
